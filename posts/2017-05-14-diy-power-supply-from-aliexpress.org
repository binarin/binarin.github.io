title: DIY power supply from AliExpress
---

Just finished soldering and assembling a [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Kit-LM317-Adjustable-Regulated-Voltage-Step-down-Power-Supply-Suite-Module-Free-Shipping/32563951591.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.fAKrUW][DIY power supply]] purchased
from AliExpress. I don't think I'm going to use it for powering
anything important (even during prototyping), because very small
changes applied to the potentiometer result in a big changes to
voltage. And I'm a bit wary that I can burn out something just by
accidentally touching the handle. Maybe I'll look into replacing the
potentiometer with a precision multi-turn one - this should greatly
improve things.

Yet I'm quite happy with it as a learning experience in soldering -
it's the biggest thing I've soldered so far =)

And in the end there were even some spare parts left. I liked the idea
with the extra resistors - each nominal value came in different
quantity, so you can distinguish them not only by color code, but
simply by counting.

Then there were some nuisances with assembly - the power cord didn't
fit the hole in the case, some bolts were longer than needed, some
small cracks appeared on the case. But overall I'm very satisfied -
given the price and all the fun I had =)
