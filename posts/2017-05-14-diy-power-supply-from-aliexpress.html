<p>Just finished soldering and assembling a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Kit-LM317-Adjustable-Regulated-Voltage-Step-down-Power-Supply-Suite-Module-Free-Shipping/32563951591.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.fAKrUW">DIY power supply</a> purchased from AliExpress. I don’t think I’m going to use it for powering anything important (even during prototyping), because very small changes applied to the potentiometer result in a big changes to voltage. And I’m a bit wary that I can burn out something just by accidentally touching the handle. Maybe I’ll look into replacing the potentiometer with a precision multi-turn one - this should greatly improve things.</p>

<p>Yet I’m quite happy with it as a learning experience in soldering - it’s the biggest thing I’ve soldered so far =)</p>

<p>And in the end there were even some spare parts left. I liked the idea with the extra resistors - each nominal value came in different quantity, so you can distinguish them not only by color code, but simply by counting.</p>

<p>Then there were some nuisances with assembly - the power cord didn’t fit the hole in the case, some bolts were longer than needed, some small cracks appeared on the case. But overall I’m very satisfied - given the price and all the fun I had =)</p>
