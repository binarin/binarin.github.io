    <h2>DIY power supply from AliExpress</h2>
    <div class="post__publish-date">14 May 2017</div>
    <p>Just finished soldering and assembling a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Kit-LM317-Adjustable-Regulated-Voltage-Step-down-Power-Supply-Suite-Module-Free-Shipping/32563951591.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.fAKrUW">DIY power supply</a> purchased
from AliExpress.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to use it for powering
anything important (even during prototyping), because very small
changes applied to the potentiometer result in a big changes to
voltage. And I&rsquo;m a bit wary that I can burn out something just by
accidentally touching the handle. Maybe I&rsquo;ll look into replacing the
potentiometer with a precision multi-turn one - this should greatly
improve things.</p>

<p>Yet I&rsquo;m quite happy with it as a learning experience in soldering -
it&rsquo;s the biggest thing I&rsquo;ve soldered so far =)</p>

<p>And in the end there were even some spare parts left. I liked the idea
with the extra resistors - each nominal value came in different
quantity, so you can distinguish them not only by color code, but
simply by counting.</p>

<p>Then there were some nuisances with assembly - the power cord didn&rsquo;t
fit the hole in the case, some bolts were longer than needed, some
small cracks appeared on the case. But overall I&rsquo;m very satisfied -
given the price and all the fun I had =)</p>
