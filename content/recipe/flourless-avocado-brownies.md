| 1/4 tsp salt (if your nut butter is salted omit or reduce)                                    |   |
| 1/3 cup Swerve (erythritol) or preferred granulated sweetener (coconut palm, maple sugar etc) |   |
| 1/3 cup cacao powder                                                                          |   |

-   Pre-heat oven to 175℃.
-   Line a small baking dish (I used a 5x7 Pyrex) with parchment paper.
-   In the bowl of your blender or food processor combine all of the ingredients.
-   Blend om medium, low power until just smooth. No more than 30 seconds.
-   Use a spatula to transfer the batter into the baking dish and smooth it out evenly.
-   Top with fun things if you wish. I'm partial to cacao nibs.
-   Bake for 25 minutes. If you're using a metal baking dish it could be less time. Check it after 20 minutes. It's done when the top begins to crack and it has turned a deep brown color. The top will be slightly soft but dry to the touch.
-   Remove from the oven and let it cool for 15 minutes before handling.


## TROUBLESHOOTING: {#troubleshooting}

-   DO NOT OVER MIX! I actually made this mistake once. I made an extra large batch and blended it wayyyyy toooo long. Once everything is combined and the avocado is smooth, done. No need for overkill
-   Make sure your avocado is medium-large and ripe but firm. When you scoop it out, measure it in a measuring cup. 3/4 -1 cup of avocado gently pressed down.
-   Don’t skimp on the nut/seed butter, use measuring spoons and a spatula to scrape them out! Make sure your nut or seed butter is 100% almond, sunflower or peanut or cashew… no added oils or other fats, that may impede the cooking process.
-   Add more sweetener? These brownies are lightly sweetened to optimize the healthy factor, but you can use up to 1/2 a cup of sweetener to give them a more indulgent flavor.
-   I’ve edited the recipe from 1/4 rounded cup to 1/3 cup cacao… just to err on the side of caution. Not using enough cacao powder will result in eggy or avocado tasting brownies.
