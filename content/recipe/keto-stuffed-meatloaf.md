| ground beef          | 500 grams  |

-   Mix the meat with the salt, pepper, garlic, and cumin. In a small greased bread (or meatloaf) pan, line the bottom and sides with the minced beef, leaving a hole for your stuffing.
-   Layer the cheese on the bottom of the meatloaf.
-   Add in the onions, spinach and mushrooms.
-   Use the leftover meat to place on top, covering the spinach and mushrooms, acting as a lid.
-   Bake at 175°C for one hour.
