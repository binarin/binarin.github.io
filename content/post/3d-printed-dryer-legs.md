Our robotic vacuum was constanstly being stuck by trying to go over
a clothes drying rack. So I've decided to raise it a bit about the
floor, and 3D-printed some legs for it.

It was also one of the first prints that I did with ABS after
building an enclosure. The last picture is a 3D-printed template
for drilling. I wouldn't say that it turned very precise, but it
worked nevertheless. To make it more precise a few stiffeners need
to be added here and there, but more important is to put an
aprropriately sized metal tube inside.
