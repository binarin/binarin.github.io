Looks like I'm printing a lot of legs for different things, just to make life
of our home robotic cleaner easier. Now it's for a nightstand,
which was of exactly wrong height for our robot.

It was high enough not to notice it with sensors, but low enough to catch it
with its highest spot. When this happened, it was just driving
around a room with the whole nightstand on top of it.

That's how offending nightstand and its new legs look like:
